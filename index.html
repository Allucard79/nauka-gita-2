        <h3>Resist the Temptation</h3>
        <p class="lirycs">
            Resist the temptation of the beast<br>
            You'll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep<br>
            The venom is contagious, beware of its spell<br>
            What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell<br><br>
            I wonder if she knows the devil's taken off her clothes<br>
            Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control<br>
            Poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse<br>
            Wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse and oh, how it hurts<br><br>
            The children pay the biggest price<br>
            Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life<br>
            Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap<br>
            Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack<br><br>
            Keep them in a daze, don't let them see the other way<br>
            Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day<br>
            See they never got a breath of the sunshine<br>
            Now the kids addicted and only hit it one time<br>
            We are destined to be dead as a nation<br>
            Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation<br>
            Gamble for your soul with the devil<br>
            You wonder how low can you go before you reach the lowest level<br>
            As everybody sits and stares<br>
            There's no use looking in you eyes ?cause there isn't anybody there<br>
            And though it may make you wanna cry<br>
            Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why<br>
            I guess you think they will understand<br>
            You feel cold ?cause you sold your soul to the dope-man<br>
            Now there's no turning back, in fact<br>
            It's decided that would live and die for the crack<br>
            You got no friends ?cause you cheated them all<br>
            You feel lonely, low, defeated and small<br>
            No one was there when I took the wrong path<br>
            And nobody cared if I died in a blood bath<br>
            But is this my destiny?<br>
            Tell the Lord they got my mind but he can have the rest of me<br>
            'Cause I'm ready to end it all<br>
            One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all<br>
            I didn't mean to be a bother<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            A failure as a son, a husband and a father<br>
            I wish I could turn back the time<br>
            Go back and let it find why I let it crack my mind<br>
            And my only explanation, it came to this<br>
            Resist the temptation<br>
        </p>

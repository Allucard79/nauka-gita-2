            Resist the temptation of the beast<br>
            You'll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep<br>
            The venom is contagious, beware of its spell<br>
            What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell<br>
            I wonder if she knows the devil's taken off her clothes<br>
            Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control<br>
            Poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse<br>
            Wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse and oh, how it hurts<br>
            The children pay the biggest price<br>
            Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life<br>
            Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap<br>
            Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack<br>
            Keep them in a daze, don't let them see the other way<br>
            Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day<br>
            See they never got a breath of the sunshine<br>
            Now theâ€¦

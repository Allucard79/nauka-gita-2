            Resist the temptation of the beast
            You'll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep
            The venom is contagious, beware of its spell
            What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
            I wonder if she knows the devil's taken off her clothes
            Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control

            The children pay the biggest price
            Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
            Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
            Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack
            Keep them in a daze, don't let them see the other way
            Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
            See they never got a breath of the sunshine
            Now theâ€¦
